## Model file processing  模型文件处理

First, I attempted to import the scanned guitar obtained from the 3D scanner app into Blender to check the model. I found that there were many uneven surfaces and incomplete parts.

先尝试把3D scanner app上传照片得到扫描的吉他导入Blender中看看模型情况，发现有很多凹凸不平的面和残缺破面

Such a model is very difficult to handle and it also affects the printing effect. So I changed my approach and sent the photos of the scanned guitar that I uploaded in the 3D scanner app to the Tencent 3D Hengyuan website. This resulted in generating a relatively high-quality white model of the guitar.

这样的模型很难处理，也会影响打印效果，于是我转换思路，把我用于3D scanner app中上传扫描的照片交给腾讯3D混元网站，生成一个质量比较高的吉他白模

The generated model is completely closed and free of non-manifold errors. Therefore, I finally chose to print the model without re-topology.

生成的模型是完全封闭、没有非流形的错误，所以我最后采用没有重拓补的模型进行打印

## Importing the model into Ultimaker Cura   模型导入Ultimaker Cura

After setting up the printer, import the obj model into the software, adjust the model to the appropriate size, and make it contact the bottom surface with the largest and flattest area. Since there are suspended areas, I added supports.

设置好打印机后把obj模型导入到软件中，调整模型到合适的大小，用面积最大、最平整的部分接触底面，由于有悬空面，所以我添加了支撑。

Everything is ready! Slice the model and export it, then start the printing process!

准备就绪，把模型切片后导出，开始打印！

## Printing  打印

Turn on the heating nozzle. I chose the yellow PLA material that closely matches the color of the guitar. Turn on the heating nozzle, then add the material.

Next, select the file and proceed with the printing.

加热喷头，我选中了比较贴合吉他颜色的黄色PLA材料，加热喷头，加入材料。

接下来选择文件，进行打印。
